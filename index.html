	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>Hi, My name is Melissa Pacheco, and I'm a junior at Mercer University majoring in Software Development and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I currently work as a paralegal at a law office in Atlanta, balancing work, school, and family life.</p>
	<p>I am a proud mom to two amazing boys who inspire me every day. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, hiking, and spending as much time outdoors as possible. It helps me recharge and stay grounded.</p>
	<p>I am still discovering my path in technology, but I am excited to be part of a field that is constantly evolving and full of opportunities. I am eager to keep learning, growing, and finding my place where I can make a meaningful impact.</p>
